# üèà University Football Injury Prediction (UFIP)  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project leverages the **University Football Injury Prediction Dataset (UFIP)** to build machine learning models that predict the likelihood of a university football player sustaining an injury in the next academic season.  

The dataset provides comprehensive physical, fitness, lifestyle, and football-related metrics of **800 Chinese university football players**, making it a valuable resource for **sports science research, injury prevention, and applied machine learning**.

## üìä Dataset Details  
- **Samples:** 800 players  
- **Features:** 18 input features + 1 target label  
- **Target:** `Injury_Next_Season` (Binary classification ‚Üí `0 = No Injury`, `1 = Injury`)  
- **Balance:** Well-balanced dataset  
- **Age Range:** 18‚Äì24 years (typical university students)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow / Pipeline  

The notebook follows a structured **ML pipeline**:  

1. **Data Understanding & Exploration**  
   - Import libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.)  
   - Load dataset into pandas DataFrame  
   - Explore feature distributions, summary statistics, and correlations  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (if any)  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., Playing Position, Warm-up Routine Adherence)  
   - Scale/normalize numerical features  
   - Train-test split with stratification  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizations of physical, lifestyle, and football-specific features  
   - Injury distribution across different factors (e.g., position, training hours, stress level)  
   - Boxplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost  
   - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC  
   - Cross-validation with stratified sampling  

5. **Model Comparison**  
   - Compare results across models using key metrics  
   - Identify best-performing algorithm(s) for injury prediction  

6. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Highlight key risk factors  
   - Suggest preventive measures for student athletes
